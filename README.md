# Work Day Scheduler

The present project features a calendar app to help with scheduling.

When the webpage loads, a blank daily calendar appears.

The current date is displayed at the top, with a work day scheduler below.

_Past time_ (hours) is **grey**.

_Current time_ (hourly) is **red**.

_Future times_ (hours) that have yet to pass are **green**.

When users **click** on a given **time slot**, they can **input text** to create an item for that time block.

When users **click** the **save** button located to the right of each time block, their data will be **saved** in the event that the page is refreshed.

Below is screenshot of the application being used at 1:28 pm -- as such, the 1:00 PM time slot is red.
